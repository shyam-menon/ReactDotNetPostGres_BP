   - `UserID` (Primary Key)
   - `Username`
   - `Password`
   - `Role` (Admin, Project Manager, Team Lead)
   - `Email`

2. **Sprint**
   - `SprintID` (Primary Key)
   - `Name`
   - `StartDate`
   - `EndDate`
   - `CreatedBy` (Foreign Key to User)

3. **Task**
   - `TaskID` (Primary Key)
   - `SprintID` (Foreign Key to Sprint)
   - `Type`
   - `Description`
   - `EstimatedTime` (hrs)

   - `CopilotUsed` (Boolean)
   - `CopilotTime` (mins)
   - `Outcome`
   - `Notes`
   - `AssignedTo` (Foreign Key to User)

4. **HistoricalData**
   - Maintains historical records of sprints and associated metrics for trend analysis.

### Relationships

- **User to Task:** One-to-Many (A user can be assigned multiple tasks)
- **Sprint to Task:** One-to-Many (A sprint contains multiple tasks)
- **User to Sprint:** One-to-Many (Admins and Project Managers can create multiple sprints)

## User Interface Design Principles

1. **Intuitive Navigation**
   - Clear and consistent navigation menus (e.g., sidebar for main sections).
   - Easy access to key functionalities like sprint creation, dashboard views, and user management.

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the application is accessible and user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes.

3. **Interactive Visualizations**
   - Utilize charts (bar, line, pie) and graphs to represent data metrics.
   - Allow users to interact with visual elements for deeper insights (e.g., hover for details, click to drill down).

4. **Customization**
   - Provide options for users to select and arrange the metrics they wish to display on their dashboards.
   - Save user preferences for a personalized experience.

5. **Accessibility**
   - Follow accessibility standards to ensure the app is usable by all team members, including those with disabilities.
   - Implement features like keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast.
